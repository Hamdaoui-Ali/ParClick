# ParClick
ParClick ‚Äì Smart Parking Management in Django: QR tickets, client reservations, employee validation, and history tracking.

ParClick is a full-stack Django application that streamlines parking reservations for clients and operational oversight for employees. It features real-time availability, QR-code tickets, automated pricing, and an employee dashboard for validation and history tracking.

- Live QR-tickets for entry/validation
- Time-based pricing for cars and motorcycles
- Client self-service booking and history
- Employee dashboard for managing places, reservations, and validation

## ‚ú® Features

- Client UX
  - Browse available places and make reservations
  - Instant price estimation based on duration and vehicle type
  - Download QR code ticket
  - Manage and cancel reservations
  - View reservation history

- Employee UX
  - Secure login and session-based access
  - Dashboard for active reservations
  - Validate tickets (by ticket id / time checks)
  - Manage parking places and release/occupy slots
  - Historical view of completed reservations

- Core
  - QR code generation (`qrcode`, `Pillow`)
  - PDF/print-ready tickets (via `reportlab`, optional)
  - Media storage for QR assets
  - SQLite by default; easily switch to Postgres
  - Django 5.2, Bootstrap 5 landing page

## üß± Architecture

- `client_app`: client-facing auth, reservation booking, history
- `employee_app`: employee auth, dashboard, validation, place management
- `parclick`: project config, global templates

Key models:
- `ParkingPlace(number, is_available)`
- `Reservation(client, place, vehicule_type, start_time, end_time, duration, price, payment_type, qr_code)`
- `History(...)` for completed reservations

Note: The repo includes separate `Client` and `Employee` models. In a production setup, you‚Äôd typically consolidate to a single `User` with a `role` field. This project keeps them separate to showcase role-specific workflows.

## üöÄ Quickstart

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.10+
- pip / venv

Setup:
```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd parclick
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# env
copy .env.example .env  # fill values (optional for local)
# DB + media
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py createsuperuser

# seed demo data (optional)
python manage.py create_parking_places
python manage.py create_employee
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit:
- Landing: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- Client: http://127.0.0.1:8000/client/home/
- Employee: http://127.0.0.1:8000/employee/login/

## üîê Environment

Create `.env` (see `.env.example`):
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- `DJANGO_DEBUG`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- `DATABASE_URL` (optional, for Postgres)
- `MEDIA_ROOT`, `STATIC_ROOT` (deployment)

## üì∏ Screenshots

Place images in `docs/screenshots/` and reference them here:
- Landing page

- QR ticket
- Employee dashboard

Example:
```markdown
![Welcome](docs/screenshots/welcome.png)
![Reservation](docs/screenshots/reservation.png)
![Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)
```

## üß™ Tests (suggested)

- Ticket uniqueness
- Price calculation (car vs motorcycle)
- Reservation time validation
- Cancelation releases parking place
- Employee validation flow

Run:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- Consolidate auth to single `User(role=CLIENT|EMPLOYEE)`
- Prevent double-booking with transactional locks
- Add REST API and SPA frontend (React/Vue)
- Add payment gateway
- Add CI (lint, test) and Dockerfile
